    <h1>Interests & Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies that keep
      me engaged and inspired. Here are a few things I enjoy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Web Comics: I have a penchant for web comics and regularly indulge in
        various online series. From humorous strips to captivating storylines,
        web comics offer a delightful escape and often inspire my creative
        endeavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading: While I may not read as many books as some, I still enjoy
        exploring articles, blog posts, and online content related to
        technology, design, and other topics of interest. I appreciate the
        wealth of knowledge and diverse perspectives that reading provides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exploring Virtual Worlds: Gaming is a passion of mine, and I love
        immersing myself in virtual worlds and interactive storytelling. From
        exploring vast landscapes to solving intricate puzzles, gaming allows me
        to unwind and engage in immersive experiences.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While my hobbies may not include interesting activities, they still
      bring me joy and enrich my life in unique ways. They provide me with
      opportunities for creativity, relaxation, and exploration, shaping my
      perspective and influencing my work as a web developer.
